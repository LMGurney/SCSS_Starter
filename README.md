# SCSS_Starter
This is a contrived example used in a course to explore SassScript and design. 
When complete, we will implement a variables file, utilize a replacement variables file to demonstrate the impact of imported files, develop media responsive visible menu to hamburger menu based on breakpoints, use nested design elements. Utilizes mixins, imports, media queries, breakpoints, extends, and others aspects. May diverge from expected patterns based on in-class activities.
